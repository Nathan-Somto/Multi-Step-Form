## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### What I learned

**Never Use Vanilla Javascript for a Project**
 
 like seriously the amount of 

 ```js 
 undefined, null ,NaN
 ``` 
 I had in this project was crazy,
   I also had to cope without intellisense, pain.
So basically from now on Typescript all the way.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
'Vanilla Javascript' === 'Pain' //returns  True
```


### Continued development

Build more React js based projects
